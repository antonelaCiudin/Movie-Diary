## Movie Diary

That project was developed by me and 2 other colleagues. It allows searching for movies and adding them to lists such as: watched, liked, to watch etc. The app has some default lists, but it also has the option to create your own lists. The application also offers some statistics calculated based on the movies watched.
 
For this application we used Flutter, Firebase from Google and several packages from pub.dev, such as omdb_dart used to access a movie database.
